CS 260 Startup Application Project

I am quite familiar with `git` from work in other classes and from my use of it at my job. As such, many of the basic commands and ideas covered in this section were not new to me. However, there were a couple of new things that I learned in the process. First and foremost, I had never really used VSCode's UI to make `git` commands, instead always opting for the command line. Seeing how that GUI worked was interesting and I can see how it would be useful. Also, when I first pulled down the conflicting branch from GitHub, I was presented with a fatal error in my command line. It turns out that I needed to specify whether or not `git pull` would do a `rebase` or a `merge` when there was a conflict. I had to do some research about the differences between these two methods and why I should chose either option. This helped me better understand the process of resolving merge conflicts. Overall, even though this was mainly a review of concepts I was already familiar with, there were still new things that I was able to learn about `git` and how to make the most of it in development.

This is a modification from VSCode.

This is another modification from GitHub.

This is another modification from VSCode. It will cause a merge conflict. Now resolved.
