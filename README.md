# Startup Deliverable
## Elevator Pitch
One of the most well known ways to break the ice or start a new conversation is to ask about the weather. Sometimes we even joke about how simple of a conversation starter this is. So, why don't we actually get some useful information from our chats about the weather? WeatherChat is the weather app that lets the community chat about the weather and help each other out. Is it raining? Let the town know! Is there ice on the roads? Let your neighbors know that they should be careful out there! WeatherChat turns the old school weather ice breaker into crowdsourced, accurate weather data.

### GitHub Assignment

CS 260 Startup Application Project

I am quite familiar with `git` from work in other classes and from my use of it at my job. As such, many of the basic commands and ideas covered in this section were not new to me. However, there were a couple of new things that I learned in the process. First and foremost, I had never really used VSCode's UI to make `git` commands, instead always opting for the command line. Seeing how that GUI worked was interesting and I can see how it would be useful. Also, when I first pulled down the conflicting branch from GitHub, I was presented with a fatal error in my command line. It turns out that I needed to specify whether or not `git pull` would do a `rebase` or a `merge` when there was a conflict. I had to do some research about the differences between these two methods and why I should chose either option. This helped me better understand the process of resolving merge conflicts. Overall, even though this was mainly a review of concepts I was already familiar with, there were still new things that I was able to learn about `git` and how to make the most of it in development.

This is a modification from VSCode.

This is a modification from GitHub.

This is another modification from GitHub.

This is another modification from VSCode. It will cause a merge conflict. Now resolved.

### Notes from simon-html assignment

This assignment was quite interesting. I learned quite a few new things. In particular, I found it quite interesting how many HTML tags are purely for semantics and don't serve much of a visual purpose. Surely they'll come in handy in future things, but it was interesting to see how much HTML is about structure that isn't even visible on the site. I also found it interesting seeing how the header/footer for each page had to be copied over because they were in different documents. I also learned a bit about `.sh` scripts and the need to set them as executable when creating new ones. Overall this was a very useful assignemnt.
